Java8 - VAVR Examples of functionla Style Programming
------------------------------------

The basic examples were taken from the article series "Refactoring to Functional Style" by Venkat 
Subramaniam, PragPub 2017, vol 01..12.

The idea is to go from imperative style to functional. The funtional solutions should be represented
by plain Java8 and by using the library vavr (aka javaslang).
